This visualization tool shows long-term fire service coverage across several performance measures, including existing conditions, optimized NFPA standards, augmented response time, and fulfilled response for the City of Mississauga located in Ontario, Canada. The map also displays incident spread and station locations, allowing spatial patterns to be viewed in one place. The tool draws inspiration from the web-GIS platforms commonly used by municipal fire departments and other city divisions to present operational programs. However, unlike those systems that are typically built on commercial platforms such as ESRI, this tool runs entirely in a web browser and can be hosted on GitHub Pages, offering an accessible, open-source way to share spatial results and support discussions on emergency response planning. Our aim is twofold: to present the research methodology in a clear visual format, and to enable researchers to communicate and transmit on their findings through interactive tools that reach a wider audience.
